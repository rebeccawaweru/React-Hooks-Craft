//1.what do you like and dislike about React?
//love unidirectional flow from parent to child and the fact that react is pretty much javascript
//Disliked JSX
//2. Conditional rendering and List rendering
//what is the significance of having the key prop when rendering a list of elements(answer: react compares elements under the hood  to re-render only what is changed)
//what is the potential bug that you can introduce when using index as a key
//3. Class components's lifecycle methods
//there may be legacy code that you need to maintain(that had used classes)
//learn the mounting phase, the updation phase and the unmounting phase methods
//order of invocation and a brief description of when you'd use each one of them
//4.Context API
// What is prop drilling, how can i overcome prop drilling using context API
//5. React Hooks 
//what is the need for hooks
//useState, useEffect and useContext...
//how useEffect relates to componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate & componentWillUnmount
//6. Optimization
//Pure Components, memo, useMemo & useCallback - help prevent unnecessary re-renders in react application
//7. How to share logic across components?
//Use High Order Components(HOC), Render props pattern, Custom Hooks
//8. What are some of the packages that you use along with React
//for styling e.g tailwind, material ui
//for routing e.g react-router
//Form Handling e.g formik&yup
//State Management e.g redux
//if i use CRA(Create React App) or custom webpack configuration,,,and why
//react ecosystem
//9.What is code splitting 

//REDUX
//1. What is redux (state mangement library that can solve problem of prop drilling)
//How do you decide whether to choose Context API or Redux? if a small project, Context with useReducer may be the way to go but if large project use Redux
//2. Explain the different parts of redux
//redux store, actions, action creators, reducers
//how control flows between these different parts
//what exactly does the connect function do from the react-redux library?
//what do mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps actually do?
//why should you dispatch an action to update the state and not update the store directly?
//In a reducer, why should you return a new object as state and not modify the existing state?
